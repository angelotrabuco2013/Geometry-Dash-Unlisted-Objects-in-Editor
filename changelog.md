# v1.2.3
 * Added another unlisted object: A secret coin which can only be used on main levels.

# v1.2.2
 * Added another unlisted object: An early version of the end trigger that does not work

# v1.2.1
 * Added another unlisted object: A weird looking block that uses a mishmash of textures

# v1.2.0
 * Added more unlisted objects
 * Moved the "Start Pos" block to the blocks tab. I disagree in thinking it goes here, but I understand the logic behind it. 

# v1.1.0
 * Made more compatible with different versions of Geode
 * I found the cause of the bug where objects would leak into the edit tab, so I fixed it, and moved some of the objects into tab 0.
